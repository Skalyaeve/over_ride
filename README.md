# Over Ride
"If you thought Rainfall was easy, here’s a more daunting challenge. Override is last ISO that will have you search for faults present in the protected binaries, and re-build these binaries depending on their behavior."

As a developer, you might have to work on softwares that will be used by hundreds of people. You have learned to develop more or less complex programs without taking security into account. With this project, you will realize that your programs are full of breaches that can be easily exploitable by some malicious users. But here’s good news: you can avoid them very easily! Once you’re through with this project, not only will you have avoided these pitfalls, but you will have a clearer understanding of the RAM. And this will really help you design a bugless program!

This project aims to further your knowledge in the world of elf-like binary exploitation in i386 system. The more or less complex methods you will use will give you a new perspective on IT in general but mostly raise your awareness on issues coming from common programming malpractice. You will be challenged during this project. You have to overcome these challenges by yourself. The way you’ll be dealing with these challenges must be yours and YOURS ONLY. The point is to help you develop some logic and acquire reflexes that will help you all along your career. Before asking for help, ask yourself if you have factored in all the possibilities.
